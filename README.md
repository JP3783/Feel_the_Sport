My project is about exploring how haptic technology could change the way we experience sports as fans. We've always watched sports through sight and sound (seeing the action unfold on screen, hearing the crowd, the commentary, and the sounds of the game). But with the rise of data tracking in sports (like monitoring the heart rates of athletes in events such as Rugby or measuring the intensity of the impact when the ball hits the racquet in Tennis), we now have access to a whole new world of information. Imagine translating data into tangible sensations through touch. Haptic technology could allow spectators to feel real-time aspects of the game (such as the impact of a rugby tackle) enhancing the viewing experience with a new level of immersion. This added layer of sensation could make watching the game more immersive, making us feel more connected to what’s happening in a way that sight and sound alone can’t offer.
